# Project management

### Examples of hypothetical questions
Imagine you are in charge of organizing the grand opening of a new office in Bangalore, India. What steps would you take to plan this event?
Things to consider for your answer:
* The objective of the event, and measurement of success.
* Who will be invited to the event.
* Logistics around the event, set-up, location, timing.
* Stakeholders to involve in the process.

### Small task management
1. What problem am I solving
2. Context of the issue (could be implicit)
	* Stakeholder, impact radius
	* Priority and justification, why I am working on it now
	* Impact of no delivery
	* Timeline, hard deadline
3. Data points (metrics), solution (design doc, code review), validation (test, QA signoff, etc)
4. ETA and release (change request, dashboard etc)


### Major product management

1. What is the problem to solve?
	* Whom reporting to, stakeholder
	* Objective, success metrics
	* Role and cross-funcitonal expectation
	* Cost, budget, resource, impact expectation
	* Situation, environment, context
2. Options for solutions
	* Constraints, timeline, hard deadline, tech/resource limits
	* Requirement specifications, SLAs, size estimates, LOE, ownership, mocks, Prototype or POC
	* Choices with pros and cons, possible impacts, results
	* Priorities, communication and signoff
	* Conflict of interests, consensus resolution, escalation path, legal consultation
3. Delivery of solution
	* Roadmap; sub-deliverables teams and POC; TPM, QA team; Release plan and Operation support (dashboard, monitors, alarms etc)
	* Iterations on requirements and designs, change of priorities
	* Design doc review and signoff; Prototype or POC
	* Flexible agile process in early stage; scrum near release, periodic async/sync status update
	* Test festival, bug bash or even war room (when extremely complex coordination required)
	* System change management review, approval, and notification. Incremental release when possible
4. Evaluation, feedback, maintenance and post release
	* Release announcement
	* Production metrics service tuneup
	* Post-launch fast follow-ups and bugfixes
	* Retrospective, feedbacks from stakeholders, teams, partners etc
	* Operation monitorinig, oncall etc
